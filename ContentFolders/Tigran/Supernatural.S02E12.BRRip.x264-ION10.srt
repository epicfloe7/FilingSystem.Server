where he left off.

00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:08,048

The family business.

[WOMAN SCREAMING]

4
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:18,100
REPORTER [ON TV]: Their attacker,
a white male, 24 to 30 years of age.

5
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,060
-Not a good picture.
-Shape-shifter?

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,772
DEAN: Every culture has a shape-shifter.
-Something that looks like anyone?

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,608
Freeze. Stay on your knees.

8
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,319
-He's been held on suspicion of murder.
-Murder?

9
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,993
WOMAN: We're here downtown in front
of the City Bank of Milwaukee...

10
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,371
...and though a short exchange
of gunfire occurred minutes ago...

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,707
...police and SWAT teams
maintain position...

12
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,793
...as we enter the third hour
of this intense standoff.

13
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:49,089
Authorities estimate as many as 10
hostages are being held inside the bank.

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,800
No word as yet on the identity
of the suspects or--

00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,971

-Something's happening.

16
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,850
I think they're opening the door.
Roger, are you getting this?

17
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,609

Stand down. Stand down. Hold fire.

Hey, don't shoot. Don't shoot. Please.

19
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,907
DEAN: No, no, no. Don't even
think about it. Get the hell back.

20
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,868
HENRY:
Please, don't shoot.

21
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:36,678
So, what's it like, being an FBI guy?

22
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,723
Well, it's dangerous.

23
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,266
Yeah.

24
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,854
And the secrets we gotta keep.
Oh, God, the secrets.

25
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,191
But mostly, it's lonely.

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,112
-I so know what you mean.
-Yeah.

27
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,573
Helena was our head buyer. She--

28
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,244
She was family, you know?
She said it herself.

29
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,123
Every Christmas party she said
we were the only family she had.

30
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,625
There were no signs
that she'd do this?

31
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,378
No, I still can't believe it, even now.

32
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,756
That night, Helena came back
to the store after closing.

33
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,259
Cleaned out all the display cases
and the safe.

34
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,721
Edgar, our night watchman,
he caught her in the act.

35
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,474
He didn't know what to do.
He'd known her for years.

36
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,477
He called me at home.

37
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,230
And that's when she took his gun?

38
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,275
She shot him in the face.

39
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,611
I heard him die...

40
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,071
...over the phone.

41
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,157
Any idea what
her motive could've been?

42
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,284
What motive? It makes no sense.

43
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:46,081
Why steal all those diamonds, jewelry,
then what, just dump it somewhere?

44
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,418
Just hide it and then go home and--

45
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,003
She killed herself?

46
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,423
The cops said she dropped a hairdryer
in the bath and fried herself.

47
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,425
They should know, right?

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,677
Yeah.

49
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,139
Well, thanks, Frannie.
Think that's all I need.

50
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,767
Really? I mean, because I've got more.

51
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,605
You know, if you wanted to
interview me...

52
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,608
...sometime, in private?

53
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,778
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

54
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:22,201
You're a true patriot, you really are.
Why don't you write your number down?

55
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,788
So you never saw the security camera
footage yourself, then.

56
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,917
The police, they took all the tapes,
first thing.

57
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,168
Of course they did.

58
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,176
Look at your file, this is it.

59
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,553
-Frigging cops.
-They're just doing their job.

60
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,307
No, they're doing our job.
Only they don't know it, so they suck at it.

61
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:49,311
-Talk to me about this bank.
-Milwaukee National Trust.

62
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,189
-It was hit a month ago.
-Same M.O. as the jewelry store?

63
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,734
Inside job, long-time employee.
The never-in-a-million-years type.

64
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,655
Dude robs the bank, then goes home
and supposedly commits suicide.

65
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:03,700
DEAN: Reznick was the guard on duty?
-He was beaten unconscious...

66
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,161
-...by the teller who heisted the place.
-God.

67
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,663
Yeah.

68
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,207
Mr. Reznick?

69
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,501
Ronald Reznick?

70
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,838
Son of a--

71
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,223
FBI, Mr. Reznick.

72
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,183
Let me see the badge.

73
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,566
Already gave my statement
to the police.

74
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,194
Ronald, just some things
about your statement.

75
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,071
We want some clarification on it.

76
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,490
-You read it?
-Sure did.

77
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,535
-Come to listen to what I gotta say?
-That's why we're here.

78
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,708
Well, come on in.

79
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,129
None of the cops ever called me back.

80
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,589
Not after I told them
what was really going on.

81
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,217
They all thought I was crazy.

82
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,595
First off, Juan Morales never robbed
the Milwaukee National Trust.

83
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,514
That I guarantee.

84
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,308
Me and Juan were friends.

85
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,103
He used to come back to the bank on
my night shifts and we'd play cards.

86
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,524
So you let him into the bank that night.
After hours.

87
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,110
The thing I let into the bank...

88
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,321
...wasn't Juan.

89
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,408
I mean it had his face,
but it wasn't his face.

90
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,577
Every detail was perfect
but too perfect.

91
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,539
Like if a doll maker made it,
like, if I was talking to a big Juan doll.

92
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,958
-A "Juan doll"?
-Look.

93
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,420
This wasn't the only time.
There was this jewelry store too.

94
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,799
And the cops and you guys, I mean,
you just won't see it.

95
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,427
Both crimes were pulled
by the same thing.

96
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,929
And what's that, Mr. Reznick?

97
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,435
Chinese been working on them
and the Russians before that.

98
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,104
Part man, part machine.

99
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,982
Like the Terminator but the kind
that can change itself.

100
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,776
Make itself look like others.

101
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,277
-Like from T2.
-Exactly.

102
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:07,449
See, not just a robot.
More of a "mandroid."

103
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,117
A mandroid?

104
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,162
What makes you so sure about this,
Ronald?

105
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,087
See, I made copies
of all the security tapes.

106
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,340
I knew once the cops got them
they'd be buried. Here.

107
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,134
Now watch.

108
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,638
Watch.

109
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,140
Watch him, watch, watch.

110
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,893
See? Look, there it is.

111
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,230
You see, he's got the laser eyes.

112
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,824
Cops said it was
some kind of reflected light.

113
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,827
Some kind of "camera flare." Okay?

114
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,995
Ain't no damn camera flare.

115
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,373
They say I'm a post-trauma case.

116
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,167
So what? Bank goes and fires me?
It don't matter.

117
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,671
The mandroid is still out there.

118
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,008
The law won't hunt this thing down...

119
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,844
...I'll do it myself.

120
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:13,014
You see, this thing, it kills the real person.
Makes it look like a suicide.

121
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,016
Then it, like, morphs into the person.

122
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,186
Cases the job for a while till it knows
the take is fat...

123
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,230
...then finds its opening.

124
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,733
These robberies, they're grouped
together. So I figure...

125
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,194
...the mandroid is holed up
in the middle.

126
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,280
Underground maybe. I don't know.

127
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:33,076
Maybe that's where it recharges
its mandroid batteries.

128
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,203
Okay.

129
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,957
I want you to listen very carefully.

130
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:43,545
Because I'm about to tell you
the gods' honest truth about all of this.

131
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,300
There's no such thing as mandroids.

132
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,263
There's nothing evil or inhuman going on
out there. Just people.

133
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,390
Nothing else, you understand?

134
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,563
-The laser eyes--
-Just a camera flare.

135
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,775
I know you don't wanna believe it, but
your friend robbed the bank and that's it.

136
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,905
Get out of my house!

137
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,616
-Now.
-Sure.

138
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,992
First things first.

139
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,207
Man, that has got to be the kicker,
straight up.

140
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,626
You tell that poor son of a bitch that--

141
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,837
What did you say?
Remand the tapes that he copied?

142
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,758
Classified evidence of an ongoing
investigation? That's messed up.

143
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,344
What, are you pissed at me?

144
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,597
I think it's creepy
how good of a fed you are.

145
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:39,100
We could've thrown the guy a bone.
He did some pretty good legwork.

146
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,938
-Mandroid?
-Except for the mandroid part.

147
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,024
I liked him.
He's not that different from us.

148
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,485
-People think we're crazy.
-He's not a hunter.

149
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,612
He's a guy who
stumbled onto something.

150
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,365
If he went up against this,
he'd get torn apart.

151
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,951
Better to stay in the dark
and stay alive.

152
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,119
Yeah, I guess.

-I hate those frigging things.
-You think I don't?

157
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,053
One didn't turn into you
and frame you for murder.

158
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,808
Look, if this shifter's anything
like the one in Missouri--

159
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,268
Then Ronald's right.

160
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,399
They like to lair up underground.
Preferably the sewer.

161
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:32,988
All the robberies are connected
so far to the sewer main layout.

162
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,286
There's one more bank lined up
on that sewer main.

you know it. A routine check.

00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,946
-I like him. He says okey-dokey.
-What if he's the shifter?

172
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:20,243
Then we follow him home and put a
silver bullet through his chest plate.

00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,208
Okay. Got any popcorn?

174
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,055
Well, looks like Mr. Okey-dokey...

00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,432
...is okey-dokey.

to the sewers and--
